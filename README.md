- There are 2 players in the game
- You start with an empty 3x3 board
- Players take turns one after the other, marking the board with symbols - X and O
- Each space on the board can only be marked once
- The player who is first to go uses X to mark the board
- The player who is second to go uses O to mark the board
- The player who marks the board with 3 of their symbols in row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) wins
- If no player gets 3 of their marks in a row the game ends in a draw
